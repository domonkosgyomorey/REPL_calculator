# üìñ Description
**A multithreaded calculator [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) written in Rust mainly for learning reason**<br>

**The expression evaluation is follows the following precedence (1 is the highest priority)**<br>
| Operator | Priority |
| :- | :-: |
| `Fact` | 1 |
| `Exp`, `Sqrt` | 2 |
| `Div`, `Mul`, `Mod` | 3 |
| `Add`, `Sub` | 4 |
| `Equal`, `Not`, `Not Equal` | 5 |
| `Greater Than`, `Less Than`, `Greater Equal`, `Less Equal` | 6 |
| `Logical And`, `Bitwise And` | 7 |
| `Logical Or`, `Bitwise Or`, `Logical Xor`, `Bitwise Xor` | 8 |
**The variables inside the expression have the highest priority**

**The parenthesis is matter!**<br>

**üÜïVariables Added**<br>

**‚ö†Ô∏èWorking with Nightly toolcahin**<br>

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
[0.1 "Iterative" version](https://github.com/domonkosgyomorey/REPL_calculator/releases/tag/0.1)<br>
[0.2 Expression Tree version](https://github.com/domonkosgyomorey/REPL_calculator/releases/tag/0.2)<br>
[0.3 Functional Multithreaded REPL Calculator With Many Operators](https://github.com/domonkosgyomorey/REPL_calculator/releases/tag/0.3)

## Expression Solving recipe
- Own "Input cleaner", "Tokenizer", "Lexer"<br>
- [Shunting Yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) for converting expression into infix form<br>
- Generating [Expression Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree) from infix expression form<br>

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Supported Features

- ‚úÖ Multithreaded AST solver
- ‚úÖ Boolean ( If > 0 Than True otherwise its False )
- ‚úÖ Addition
- ‚úÖ Subtraction
- ‚úÖ Multiplication
- ‚úÖ Division (On Divided by Zero print Error)
- ‚úÖ Exponents
- ‚úÖ Square root
- ‚úÖ Factorial
- ‚úÖ Mod
- ‚úÖ Logical operators
- ‚úÖ Equality operators
- ‚úÖ Nice error handling
- ‚úÖ Logging ( Log different state of the program during the expression solving into log.txt)
- ‚úÖ Parentheses matter in the evaluation of the expression
