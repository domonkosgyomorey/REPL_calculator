# Description
**A calculator [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) written in Rust mainly for learning reason**<br>

The expression evaluation is follows the following precedence<br>
**( SQRT , EXP ) > ( MUL , DIV ) > ( ADD , SUB )**<br>

**The parenthesis is matter!**<br>

**🆕Unary operators added**

**⚠️Working with Nightly toolcahin**<br>

## Expression Solving recipe
- Own "Input cleaner", "Tokenizer", "Lexer"<br>
- [Shunting Yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) for converting expression into infix form<br>
- Generating [Expression Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree) from infix expression form<br>

## Supported Features
- ✅ unsigned 32 bit integer ( Overflow and Underflow are permitted due Rust Wrapping)
- ✅ Addition
- ✅ Subtraction
- ✅ Multiplication
- ✅ Division (On Divided by Zero print Error)
- ✅ Exponents
- ✅ Square root
- ✅ Factorial
- ❌ Bool operations
- ✅ Nice error handling
- ✅ Logging ( Log different state of the program during the expression solving into log.txt)
- ✅ Parentheses matter in the evaluation of the expression
- ✅ A handy REPL
- ✅ Automatic test
