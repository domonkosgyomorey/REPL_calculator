# üìñ Description
**A calculator [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) written in Rust mainly for learning reason**<br>

The expression evaluation is follows the following precedence<br>
**( SQRT , EXP ) > ( MUL , DIV ) > ( ADD , SUB )**<br>

**The parenthesis is matter!**<br>

**üÜïBooleans and booleans operators added**<br>

**‚ö†Ô∏èWorking with Nightly toolcahin**<br>

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
[0.1 "Iterative" version](https://github.com/domonkosgyomorey/REPL_calculator/releases/tag/0.1)<br>
[0.2 Expression Tree version](https://github.com/domonkosgyomorey/REPL_calculator/releases/tag/0.2)

## Expression Solving recipe
- Own "Input cleaner", "Tokenizer", "Lexer"<br>
- [Shunting Yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) for converting expression into infix form<br>
- Generating [Expression Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree) from infix expression form<br>

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Supported Features
- ‚úÖ unsigned 32 bit integer ( Overflow and Underflow are permitted due Rust Wrapping)
- ‚úÖ Boolean ( If > 0 Than True otherwise its False )
- ‚úÖ Addition
- ‚úÖ Subtraction
- ‚úÖ Multiplication
- ‚úÖ Division (On Divided by Zero print Error)
- ‚úÖ Exponents
- ‚úÖ Square root
- ‚úÖ Factorial
- ‚úÖ Mod
- ‚úÖ Logical operators
- ‚úÖ Equality operators
- ‚úÖ Nice error handling
- ‚úÖ Logging ( Log different state of the program during the expression solving into log.txt)
- ‚úÖ Parentheses matter in the evaluation of the expression
- ‚úÖ A handy REPL
- ‚úÖ Automatic test
